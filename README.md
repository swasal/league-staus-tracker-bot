# Riot-Stats-tracker
A status tracker for League of Legends

*** Future updates may cover other riot games ***

You need to get yourself a riot API to run this from the dev porta; => https://developer.riotgames.com/ [the API expires every 24 hours so u need to regenerate the API unless you are using a developer api]
and put it in a text file called "Apikey.txt" and the code will automatically pull the API to run the files.
*****NOTE: The code will not run without the API file.
